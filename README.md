Week 1 Challenge
=================

This was the first weekend challenge on how to use the command line. 

###Tasks

+ Lists of all students
+ Ordered by name
+ Grouped by cohort (as an exercise)
+ Adds new students by asking the user to input the names
+ Shows information about a given student
+ Add information related to a particular student (e.g. hobbies)
+ Has an interactive menu to ask the user what he or she would like to do
+ Displays information about the number of records in the directory
+ Saves data to a file
+ Loads data from a the file

+ Change into the temporary directory
+ Using one command, create a directory structure "my/private/files" 
+ Using one command, create a directory structure "my/public/files"
+ Create an empty file 't-vars.env' in my/private/files
+ Using command-line only add the line "List of env vars that begin with T" to the file, make sure it ends with a newline
+ List all env variables that begin with "T" (hint: you'll need a regex that includes the marker of the start of the line) and append them to the end of the file
+ Export a new variable TESTING_MAKERS=working in such a way that it is still available when you open a new shell
+ Open a new terminal window, check that a new variable is available
+ Output the count of the variables that begin with T to a new file my/public/files/t-vars.count, e.g. "Overall count: 5" (hint: you'll need to use 'command substitution' in bash)
+ Change the permissions of the my/private/files/t-vars.env to make sure that only the owner can read and write the file
+ Change the permissions of the my/private/files directory to make sure that only the owner can change into it
+ Give read and write permissions to all users on my/public/files/t-vars.count
+ Create another file my/public/files/text-files-count.txt and output the number of text files in your home directory (recursively)  into that file
+ List all env variables sorted alphabetically and show the top 3 lines
